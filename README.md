A nice wrapper for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Python

This was inspired by having to rewrite lots of code every time I wanted to turn a multi-dimensional list (gameboard) into a directed graph that was useable by someone else's dijkstra's algorithm code. I did not write the Dijkstra's code, but I did write the code which will convert 2D and 3D lists into directed, weighted graphs in the format that Dijkstra's algorithm wants.
